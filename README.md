ðŸ“‡EXTRACTING BUSSINESS CARD DATA WITH 'OCR'

**Problem Statement:**

You have been tasked with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).

In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.

To achieve this, you will need to use Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database
management system like SQLite or MySQL. The application should have a simple
and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the
business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information should
be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users should be able to easily
add it to the database with the click of a button. And Allow the user to Read the data,
Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit UI
This project will require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It will also require you to carefully design and plan the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Good documentation and code organization will also be important for this project.

**Approach:**

    1. Install the required packages: You will need to install Python, Streamlit,
    easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.
    
    3. Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using
    Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
    card image and extracting its information. You can use widgets like file
    uploader, buttons, and text boxes to make the interface more interactive.
    
    4. Implement the image processing and OCR: Use easyOCR to extract the
    relevant information from the uploaded business card image. You can use
    image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to
    enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.
    
    6. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted,
    display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. You can use
    widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to present the information.
    
    8. Implement database integration: Use a database management system like
    SQLite or MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded
    business card image. You can use SQL queries to create tables, insert data,
    and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to
    delete the data through the streamlit UI
    
    10. Test the application: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as
    expected. You can run the application on your local machine by running the
    command streamlit run app.py in the terminal, where app.py is the name of
    your Streamlit application file.
    
    12. Improve the application: Continuously improve the application by adding new
    features, optimizing the code, and fixing bugs. You can also add user
    authentication and authorization to make the application more secure.

**Key Features**

1. **OCR Technology:**
    Extract text from business card images using OCR engines like Tesseract or Google Vision API.
    Identify key fields like name, job title, company, phone number, email, and address.
